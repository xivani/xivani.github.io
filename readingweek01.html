		<p> <h1> Week 01 Reading responce </h1>
			After watching the series of "Ways of Seeing" videos I was suprised to see just how much of the media we consume today is both explicitly and inspired by past forms of media like paintings. The sections in the videos where the camera would pan to an advertismnet in the city and cut to a famous painting really showcased how much media today uses past works as a foundation. I think it's also important to notice the examples where our media wasn't directly pulled from the past but many share the motiffs. Some examples I saw were some advertisments that feature groups of people which in comparison to some old artworks had similar position placements for the models or invoked the same kind of emotion. While I don't think modern day artist choose to directly have their work in relation to the past it showcases how despite the time difference, many people still relate to the same set of feelings and imagery even in compleatly different settings.
