   <div class="s6t1"> <p> The “File Room” exists as both an online project and an in person exhibit. 
    For many years the File Room was hosted on servers by different organizations and open to the public. 
    This advocated for the free open knowledge to censored information that Antoni Muntadas wanted but the 
    special part of the in person exhibit was the ability for visitors to add to the database themselves.
    It did not prohibit visitors from what privileges they had while interacting with it.
    The “File room” had a fluid visual look. While some of its styles can be compared to the
     1990s “cyber” aesthetic. It’s important to understand that its visual components were also limited by 
     what graphic capabilities were possible during this era of computer media.
