<div class="s5t5"> <p id="s5t5id">The archive of cases is were the censorship cases resides
    users are allowed to explore censorship around the world here. Users had multiple ways to
     explore archived cases. One way was by using an image of the world map and prompting
     users to select which continent did they want their censored media to come from, 
     specifically moving the pointer mouse to hover over individual continents. 
     Not only did this function as a filtered search, but also gave the users a sense of the 
     of the amount of censorship that can be found all over the world and allowed them to possibly 
     wonder what information could be found somewhere that they otherwise wouldn’t have thought to 
     search for. This connects back to Muntadas’ mission to illuminate lost media that was being hidden 
     away from the public view.</p></div>
