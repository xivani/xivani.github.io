    <p>Yaya's Thoughts: Before delving further on The File Room. I want to give my thoughts on the 
        experience of the artwork. I think it was great!. I say great because people get censored
    everyday whether it is work, school, or you name it. People dont speak up because
    the fear of consequences. What we as the people fail to realize no matter
    the situation we the people have a voice and there is power against the ones doing
    censoring. There is power in numbers because the micro makes the macro.
    The little things build the bigger picture and with the File Room allow it allows people
    to report cases of censorship giving an archive of the bigger picture for different types of censorship
    going on around the world being a platform for change in the way. This concept of The File Room 
    made the overall experience of it great and enjoyable.</p></div>

    <p>Ivan's Thoughts:</p> <p id="s3textedit">I think that this project was definitely ahead of its time, 
        especially in the 1990s. For many people the internet was becoming a tool 
        to access a huge amount of information that would be previously unavailable 
        from other means at the time. Yet, even during those early stages of the world-wide-web, 
        Antoni Muntadas showcased that the public was still being actively censored by the 
        government and mass media already on this new platform. Free knowledge and open 
        access to the public describes the main functions of the “File Room” and what it 
        did accomplish three decades ago is still a struggle to achieve today.
