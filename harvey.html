      <h1>Harvey Response</h1>
      <p> From Auriea Harvey's interview one particular part I focused on was their perspective on the value and difference between physical and digital art. Often, many people will hold physical art to a higher value than digital since it's a tangible object and I believe the preconceived notion that it took direct manual labor and materials to create it sets it to a higher standard. Yet, Harvey sees it as a different approach and looks at her digital models as the original creation while the physical sculpture is an entirely different thing. They also emphasize how they're still using materials even if it's not from "the earth" itself. However, they're working with polygons that are derived from the software/computer being used and are still valid in what creations are being made.</p>
