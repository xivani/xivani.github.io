    <h1>What Is The File Room?</h1>

 <main>

    <p> 
        The File Room is a project that bring forwar and addresses censorship.
        It is a interactive open database that has records of past cases of
        censorship around the world. Antoni and his team working on the case was unable to complete his original
        goal of reintroducing deleted and supressed materials back into public
        records.
    </p>

    <p>
        So instead visitors of the site are welcomed from all over the world to add there own experiences
        of both artistic and cultural censorship to an open-ended archive. The file 
        Room is sculpted by the visitors and there experiences. It shapes an evolving archive 
        of how supression of information around the world is orchestrated throughout history
        in different contexts, countries, and civilizations.

    </p>

    <p>
        According to MUNTADAS AND RANDOLPH STREET GALLERY, 1994
        “THE FILE ROOM, RATHER THAN BEING PRESENTED AS A FINISHED WORK, IS... AN OPEN SYSTEM THAT BECOMES ACTIVATED, ‘FILED’ 
        AND DEVELOPED THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS OF ITS OWN EXISTENCE..”.
